# Unix_Commandline_copy

This repository is for one hour quick hacks at trying to make commanline copies
of unix style command line tools. This is not perfect and the code is not 
beautiful but hopfully will get better as time goes on. 

The main purpose of these miny projects are to develop a better understanding 
of argparse library and to learn more about the build in unix commandline tools.
